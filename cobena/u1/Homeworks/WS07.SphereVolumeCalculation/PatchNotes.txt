As the task was deferreed, I make a new version

V1.2.0

- Implements writer.append(), before I made a function that proccess the data
and mix the Strings written and the new, rewriting all the document, what was
inefficent.

- Implements split function and make a better view for the data saved view, 
before the program just print all the String of the file

- Order number bug when you close and start again the programm puting numbers
since 1 again, corrected.

- First line being in blank because a line being jumped, corrected
